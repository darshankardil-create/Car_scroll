## Description
This project demonstrates my frontend development skills through smooth scroll-based animations built using Next.js and GSAP.

This project is a scroll-driven car animation built using Next.js and GSAP.
As the user scrolls, the car moves horizontally across the screen while animated text reacts dynamically.
Opacity-based statistic cards appear progressively based on the car’s position, creating a storytelling effect.
The scroll position is stored in localStorage to maintain animation state even after page refresh.
